## Overview
Application uses Riot Games API and Nokia Display handled by STM32 Discovery. 
Main idea of this project is to let League of Legends players check divisions of their opponents 
and teammates faster and more convenient than by using traditional webservices.
You just type in your nickname and data is shown on display.
